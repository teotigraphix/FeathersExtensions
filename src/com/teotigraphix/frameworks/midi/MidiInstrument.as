	* General MIDI's most recognized feature is the defined list of sounds or "patches".
	* However, General MIDI does not actually define the way the sound will be reproduced,
	* only the name of that sound. Though this can obviously result in wide variations in
	* performance from the same song data on different GM sound sources, the authors of
	* General MIDI felt it important to allow each manufacturer to have their own ideas
	* and express their personal aesthetics when it comes to picking the exact timbres
	* for each sound.Each manufacturer must insure that their sounds provide an acceptable
	* representation of song data written for General MIDI. Guidelines for developing GM
	* compatible sound sets and song data are available through the MMA.
